Build a high-resolution, visually stunning, immersive 3D website for Super Next Technologies (SNT). The site must spotlight our AI division (AI Agents, AI Automations, Voice/Chat Assistants) while also presenting dedicated, tab-wise sections for Wireless Hotspot, Infrastructure, and Website Development (3D/Dynamic/Static) — including offers for Free 1-Year Domain Hosting, Free Domain, and Free Email Hosting. Implement an AI voice assistant footer using ElevenLabs (code provided below). The aesthetic should be futuristic, clean, and performant.

TECH STACK & FOUNDATIONS

Frontend: React + Vite or Next.js; 3D via React Three Fiber (Three.js); UI via TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui.

Animations: Framer Motion (page transitions, scroll reveals), GLSL-friendly materials where helpful.

Performance: Lazy-load heavy 3D scenes, use <Canvas> with optimized shadows/SSR, texture compression, route-based code splitting.

SEO: Meta tags per page, Open Graph/Twitter cards, sitemap.xml, robots.txt, semantic headings, fast LCP.

Accessibility: Keyboard focus, aria labels, reduced-motion fallback.

Global Elements: Sticky top nav, floating contact/WhatsApp button (048864215), consistent CTA buttons (“Book a Demo”, “Talk to AI Assistant”, “Request Proposal”).

Footer Voice Assistant (fixed, bottom-right): see “Footer Integration” section.
